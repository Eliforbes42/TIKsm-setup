# Flux language setup
### Manual Setup
* Flux is still in beta, so this information may be out of date
* Follow instructions laid out by [Flux Datasource for Grafana]
(https://grafana.com/plugins/grafana-influxdb-flux-datasource)


### Helpful information
* Read more about Flux [here](https://github.com/influxdata/platform/tree/master/query)
* Use the limit function to reduce the number of datapoints so that the master node of the kubernetes cluster doesn't get dropped
